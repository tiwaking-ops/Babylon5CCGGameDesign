/**
 * B5-2287: the deck builder's state and legality rules, with no Swing in it.
 *
 * <p>This class exists because the deck builder had <em>no automated coverage at
 * all</em>. Every line of its behaviour -- which factions are offered, which cards
 * the pool shows, what add and remove do, when Construct is enabled -- lived
 * inside a {@code JDialog} subclass, and a {@code JDialog} cannot be constructed
 * headlessly, so {@code showDeckBuilderDialog} returns {@code null} before the
 * constructor is ever reached. That is a gate that cannot go red: the only way to
 * reach this logic was a human clicking it.
 *
 * <p>So the rules moved here and the dialog became a view. Nothing about the
 * behaviour changed in the move; the point is that it is now reachable from
 * {@code HeadlessConformanceTest} without a display.
 *
 * <p>The split is deliberately at the seam where the rulebook is: this class owns
 * <em>what the deck is and whether it is legal</em>, and the dialog owns only
 * pixels. The legality call itself is not reimplemented here -- it delegates to
 * {@link DeckLoader#validatePlayDeck(List, Faction)}, which was written under
 * B5-1965 and, before B5-2247 wired it to a production caller, had zero callers
 * tree-wide (B5-2183 finding L1). This class is that production caller's logic;
 * {@link MainWindow} holds the pixels.
 *
 * <p>Java 6 only: explicit type arguments, no diamond, no lambdas, index loops.
