/** AI player for three difficulty tiers: EASY, MEDIUM, HARD.
 *
 *  EASY:   Random legal action.
 *  MEDIUM: Greedy — prefers actions that maximise immediate Influence gain.
 *  HARD:   Evaluative — scores board state, uses opponent awareness,
 *          targets the leading player, protects against threats.
 *
 *  Build Influence (rulebook V): offered as a legal action whenever this
 *  player's Influence Rating is 9 or below and at least one Inner Circle
 *  character is unrotated. Scored as a positive value by MEDIUM/HARD.
 *
 *  Promote Character (rulebook VI., B5-0321): offered for every affordable,
 *  ready supporting character, rotating an unrotated IC member. This is what
 *  makes Build Influence reachable: recruiting alone never grows the Inner
 *  Circle, and Build Influence needs IC characters to rotate.
 *
 *  Lead a Fleet (B5-0362; B5-0345 Tier-1 #1): every legal (leader, fleet)
 *  pair is offered as its own GameAction.LEAD_FLEET through canLeadFleet —
 *  own ready Inner-Circle or supporting character, own unrotated unled fleet.
 *  MEDIUM/HARD score it modestly by the unused Leadership it seats; HARD
 *  additionally weighs the projected leader Military into its own
 *  initiative-conflict win-probability calculation. EASY picks uniformly
 *  from the same list (difficulty contract untouched).
 *
 *  Cost-aware scoring (B5-0202 Finding 6 / B5-0324): MEDIUM and HARD subtract
 *  a card's influence cost (B5-0323 plumbing) from its positional value, so
 *  once the data carries costs the AI prefers cheaper plays. All costs are 0
 *  until the data backfill, so today's ordering is unchanged.
 *
 *  Agenda/aftermath/event scoring (B5-0344): agendas score by how close the
 *  owner's current board state is to the agenda's own win condition (the
 *  INFLUENCE_20/MILITARY_SUPREMACY/MOST_INNER_CIRCLE vocabulary already
 *  implemented in AgendaCard.isConditionMet), conflicts anticipate the
 *  aftermaths a win would unlock, aftermath cards are no longer voluntarily
 *  discarded via the generic play path (the controller auto-plays eligible
 *  ones after each conflict — an un-playable aftermath is a held resource,
 *  not a dead card), and events get a behind-the-leader catch-up bonus
 *  matching the rulebook's underdog reading of event timing. EASY stays
 *  random (the difficulty contract; B5-0351 owns its verification).
 *
 *  Mercenary bidding (B5-0403; B5-0395 engine, rulebook §Mercenaries): every
 *  offered mercenary gets one bid offer per visit — the minimal increment
 *  that puts this player strictly ahead of the best competing cumulative
 *  total (ties crown nobody) — when the applied pool can cover it. MEDIUM and
 *  HARD score the bid by win probability of the projected total versus its
 *  cost; bids spend the D9 applied pool only, never the Rating.
 *
 *  Promotion economics (B5-1708; rulebook §VI, "ACTION: Promote a
 *  Character to the Inner Circle"): MEDIUM and HARD run every
 *  PROMOTE_CHARACTER offer through evaluateCharacterCardPromotion() —
 *  the net influence delta, the supporting-role bonus (the best
 *  effective Diplomacy/Intrigue/Psi ability the character seats as an
 *  Inner-Circle member) minus RulesEngine.promotionCost — and drop
 *  promotions whose delta is negative in chooseAction() during the
 *  ACTION phase: a promotion that costs more influence than the
 *  ability it seats is an influence-losing trade. EASY keeps the full
 *  offer list (the difficulty contract, B5-0351).
 *
 *  Conflict-type weighting (B5-1709; rulebook Conflicts section):
 *  MEDIUM and HARD add a small per-difficulty preference weight to
 *  the INITIATE_CONFLICT score — CONFLICT_TYPE_WEIGHTS, keyed by
 *  ConflictType. The ledger row's "AGGRESSIVE/DIPLOMATIC" personality
 *  enums do not exist in this tree; the difficulty tier IS the
 *  personality, so HARD leans MILITARY (the aggressive posture),
 *  MEDIUM leans DIPLOMACY (the diplomatic posture), and EASY stays
 *  uniform (the difficulty contract, B5-0351). The weight is a
 *  tie-break among otherwise-equal offers, not a re-ordering of the
 *  win-probability core (B5-0301 house style: kept modest).
