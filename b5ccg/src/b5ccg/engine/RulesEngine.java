 *
 *  Build Influence (rulebook V. / VI.):
 *    - A faction may spend an action to "Build Influence" only when its
 *      Influence Rating is <= 9. The action requires rotating an Inner
 *      Circle character, spends 3 influence (raised from the faction pool,
 *      which means net rating change is -3 + 1 = -2 influence entering the
 *      pool, but the rating itself goes up by 1 — implemented here as
 *      spend 3, then +1 rating token), and raises the rating by 1.
 *      Rulebook VI.: factions with a Rating >= 10 may not use this action.

    // three paths that disagreed about what it costs, and the card types the
    // rulebook names were not all covered by any of them:
    //   - Character  -> RECRUIT_CHARACTER, cost correct (doubling :663, assistant
    //     discount :492), but NO Inner-Circle rotation is checked.
    //   - Group      -> canSponsorGroup, listed cost + absolute race gate.
    //   - Enhancement / Location / Fleet -> reachable only via PLAY_CARD's
    //     generic path, which charges the bare listed cost with no race
    //     restriction and no rotation.
    // So an other-race restricted enhancement or a hostile-race location could
    // be brought into play for its listed cost when the rulebook refuses it
    // outright (:665 "only the player controlling that race may play such
    // cards"). That is the payment defect this row names.

    // and :665 make a different-race card of any OTHER type ILLEGAL (an

     *     the ambassador is discarded to the discard pile rather than retained,
     *     which is what distinguishes a forfeit from an unconditional
     *     surrender (B5-0661), where the ambassador survives and an asylum

     *     survivor. In a two-player game that is the opponent. In a game with
     *     three or more players still standing, the forfeit removes one player
     *     and the game continues -- awarding a win here would hand victory to
     *     every remaining player and end a game the row does not say is over.
     *     checkVictory is the single authority for "is somebody winning now"

    // most influence during the turn (bids are cumulative)" and says NOTHING
    // about equal totals. B5-0395 resolved that silence conservatively: a tie

    // with a tie-break, on the authority of the row, and the change is recorded
    // in docs/DECISIONS.md so it can be reversed in one place.
    //
    // WHY INITIATIVE ORDER IS THE RIGHT KEY rather than an invented one: :352
    // is the repo's canonical statement of seat precedence ("the player with
    // the lowest Influence Rating must act first during each round"), so a
    // tie broken "in initiative order" needs no new rule at all -- it reuses
    // the one the READY round already runs.
    //
    // WHY IT IS FROZEN AT READY AND NOT RECOMPUTED AT THE MERCENARY PHASE:
    // :350-:352 makes "Determine Initiative" STEP 3 of the READY round and says
    // "Initiative order for the turn is now determined". Recomputing it at
    // MERCENARY would let a mid-turn influence GAIN silently reorder the
    // tie-break, so the same bids could resolve two ways depending on when the
    // key was read. The order is therefore frozen in startRound (the READY
    // hook) and held for the turn, which MER-TIE check MERTB-04 pins.
    //
    // DUPLICATION, NAMED NOT HIDDEN: MainWindow.initiativeKeyCompare and
    // StartingGameFlowModel.actsBefore each hold their own copy of the :352
    // chain. This is the third, and it is the only one the ENGINE plays by.

     * Five steps, in the rulebook's own order:
     *
     *   1. Discard all neutralized supporting cards (NOT neutralized Inner
     *      Circle cards).
     *   2. Players may discard as many cards from hand as they wish. That is
     *      a player choice, so the engine exposes it as
     *      {@link #discardFromHand(Player, int, GameState)} and applies no
     *      automatic discard here.
     *   3. Every player draws one free card. This step does NOT reshuffle
     *      from the discard pile: "Players who draw through their entire play
     *      deck are considered to be out of new options and may not reshuffle
     *      their discards or draw" (:447). A player whose draw pile is empty
     *      discards one non-ambassador Inner Circle character instead, and a
     *      player who cannot forfeits — both already implemented by
     *      {@link Player#drawCards(int)}.
     *   4. Each player with influence remaining may draw another card for
     *      every 3 influence applied, from the per-turn applied pool.
     *   5. Victory conditions are checked.
     *
     * <p>Note for the record: the B5-1998 ledger row asked for this step to
     * "share B5-1982's empty-deck reshuffle-from-discard approach". The
     * rulebook is canonical (AGENTS.md section 2) and forbids the reshuffle in
     * this specific step, so the reshuffle stays in AFTERMATH only. The
