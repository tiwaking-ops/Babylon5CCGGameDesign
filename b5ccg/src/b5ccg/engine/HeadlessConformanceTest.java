/**
 * B5-0308 — rulebook-conformance suite (headless).
 *
 * Extends the B5-0201 smoke-test idea: instead of exercising a full round,
 * each rule fixed from the B5-0203 audit is asserted directly against the
 * engine/model API, so a regression fails the build with a named rule.
 * New-file-only task: no game logic is modified here (B5-0201 precedent).
 *
 * Covered (fixed) rules:
 *   D1  Aftermath Won/Lost play conditions follow the INITIATOR's outcome
 *       (rulebook: Aftermath Cards / Aftermath Example).
 *   D3  Aftermath conflict-type gating incl. the PSI branch
 *       (rulebook: Type of Conflict).
 *   D8  Deck-out penalty: empty pile = no reshuffle; discard one
 *       non-ambassador Inner Circle character per required draw; forfeit
 *       when none remains (rulebook: Draw Round, Step 3).
 *
 * D12 Standard victory: 20+ power and strictly greatest; major agendas block
 *     the standard path but still win via their own condition (rulebook:
 *     Victory). Landed with B5-0305; former SKIPs converted to asserts.
 * D13 NON_ALIGNED cards behave as a normal race ("Non-Aligned IS a race
 *     name"); NEUTRAL stays universally playable (rulebook: Character
 *     Cards). Landed with B5-0305; former SKIPs converted to asserts.
 * CPT One conflict per faction per turn is enforced by the engine
 *     (B5-0302; rulebook: Conflicts). canInitiateConflict checks the
 *     GameState marker, GameController rejects illegal INITIATE_CONFLICT
 *     actions, and the marker clears at the round boundary.
 * CSD Conflict support/opposition sides: the initiator wins only when
 *     support strictly exceeds opposition; otherwise the leading opposer
 *     wins (B5-0309 / audit D14; rulebook: Conflicts). Also covers the
 *     damage rule: a loser's ambassador is damaged (face-down) on a
 *     military-resolution loss with a >= 3 gap.
 * CST Card cost field: cards carry an influence cost (default 0, negatives
 *     clamp), the loader hydrates the optional "cost" key, and recruit and
 *     promote costs compose from it with the double-for-other-race rule
 *     (B5-0323; rulebook: Anatomy of a Card, Sponsor, Promote).
 * AIS Cost-aware AI scoring: MEDIUM/HARD subtract card costs from positional
 *     values (B5-0202 Finding 6 / B5-0324). Zero costs preserve today's
 *     ordering exactly; raising a cost flips the choice; MEDIUM floors at 0.
 * PAR Participation enforcement: the optional "participation" key on conflict
 *     cards bounds who and what may commit (B5-0336; proposal §3.2). Players
 *     gate, cardTypes/fleetSubtypes filters (fleetClass-less fleets excluded),
 *     perPlayerQuota, leadersIncluded, requiresTarget at initiation, and the
 *     mandatory-commit dimensions enforced before resolution. Absent key =
 *     open participation = pre-B5-0336 behavior.
 * FLR Fleet leadership: one character per fleet may rotate to add his
 *     Leadership to that fleet's Military; character Leadership never enters
 *     MILITARY totals directly (B5-0337; audit D5, rulebook Action Details
 *     Support or Oppose). The relation expires at the round boundary.
 * LEAD Lead-a-fleet action plumbing (B5-0362; B5-0345 Tier-1 #1): the
 *     GameAction.LEAD_FLEET factory carries (leader, fleet) through the
 *     existing leader/card fields, AIPlayer's builder offers every legal
 *     pair, the controller handler reuses canLeadFleet/executeLeadFleet
 *     (rotate consumed, exactly one action per pair), MEDIUM/HARD pick the
 *     same best pair deterministically, and the relation expires at the
 *     round boundary (B5-0337).
 * AGL Agenda lifecycle (B5-0364; B5-0345 Tier-1 #3, rulebook :520/:719):
 *     DISCARD_AGENDA / REPLACE_AGENDA / REVEAL_AGENDA + sponsor one-major
 *     legality in the PLAY_CARD path. Guards: one agenda in play at a time;
 *     a Major cannot be discarded and can only be replaced by another Major;
 *     replace draws from hand, needs a ready Inner Circle leader, and never a
 *     hidden agenda; the replaced agenda is removed from the game. Hidden
 *     (face-down) agendas take no effect on play — victory conditions, the
 *     major standard bar, round income and diplomacy bonuses are all inert
 *     until reveal, which applies the on-play effect immediately.
 * AMT Aftermath targeting: non-Participant aftermaths target only the
 *     initiating faction; Participant aftermaths may target any faction that
 *     Supported/Opposed/Attacked (the resolved conflict's participants);
 *     effects land on the target; one of each named aftermath per target
 *     (B5-0338; audit D2/D4, rulebook Aftermath Cards / Participant).
 * ROT Rotate-for-effect: USE_ROTATE_EFFECT with a RotateEffectKind payload
 *     promotes the B5-0339 assistant paths to a player-chosen action
 *     (B5-0366; B5-0345 Tier-2 #5, rulebook §IV) — gate/executor delegate to
 *     the assistant primitives, controller consumes one action, round expiry
 *     clears both effects, payloads never mutate printed stats.
 * AST Ambassador's assistant: rotate a ready supporting assistant to give
 *     the ambassador +1 Diplomacy/Intrigue/Leadership while he remains
 *     rotated (computed, never mutating base stats; Psi untouched), or let
 *     the ambassador sponsor 1 influence cheaper later that turn (B5-0339;
 *     rulebook Your Ambassador's Assistant). Both effects expire at the
 *     round boundary.
 *
 * Run after compile.bat / compile.sh:
 *   java -cp b5ccg/out b5ccg.engine.HeadlessConformanceTest
 * Exit 0 only if every check passes and no SKIPped rule regressed into view.

     *       query reports MAJOR, not STANDARD — the path-order precedence from
     *       B5-0641 is preserved;</li>
     *   <li>an agenda-condition win outranks a major win (the agenda fires before
     *       major in checkVictory), and the query returns AGENDA_CONDITION with
     *       the agenda's {@code winConditionKey} as the qualifier;</li>
     *   <li>Shadow War still suppresses standard condition 1 and still admits major
     *       (B5-0629), and the query reflects that — a 20+ strictly-leading player
     *       during a Shadow War yields null (no win), while a major-qualifying
     *       player during a Shadow War yields MAJOR;</li>
     *   <li>a state with no winner returns null path (not a sentinel enum value),
     *       so a not-yet-over game is distinguishable from a game that ended with
     *       no winner;</li>
     *   <li>each path returns the correct qualifier: remaining count for last
     *       standing, station influence for condition 2, agenda
     *       {@code winConditionKey} for agenda condition, lead margin for major
     *       and standard.</li>

    /**
     * ORD (B5-0631): assert the tree's actual round-order and initiative-sequencing
     * behaviour through the real GameController loop, not by calling phases directly.
     *
     * Coverage (what exists, not what the rulebook idealises):
     *   (1) Victory check runs AFTER EVERY ACTION inside runActionPhase (GameController:136),
     *       i.e. mid-action-phase, NOT at the end-of-turn boundary. This is a divergence
     *       from rulebook III (Draw Round, Step 5: "Check Victory Conditions") and is
     *       reported here rather than fixed (game-logic changes out of scope).
     *   (2) startRound (RulesEngine) runs ONCE per turn, called from runGame() before the
     *       action phase (GameController:43). Test: confirm bonus/leadership/assistant state
     *       is reset by startRound BEFORE any action, and is NOT re-reset during the action
     *       phase loop.
     *   (3) A single player pass does NOT end the round; the D6 consecutive-pass skeleton
     *       (passCount == playerCount) is the exit, already asserted by testD6ActionLoop.
     *       This test confirms the round does NOT end early: after one player passes and the
     *       next player acts, the round number is unchanged and the active conflict (if any)
     *       is still live.
     *   (4) The round counter advances exactly ONCE per completed cycle, via
     *       GameState.advanceRound() called from runGame() AFTER the draw phase (GameController:61).
     *       GameState.advanceTurn() (GameController:143) only cycles currentPlayerIndex inside the
     *       action phase and does NOT touch roundNumber. Test: roundNumber is stable across the
     *       action phase and advances by exactly 1 after a full turn.
     *   (5) Conflict resolution plus aftermaths land INSIDE the action turn where the conflict
     *       was initiated: processAction's INITIATE_CONFLICT branch calls resolveCurrentConflict()
     *       synchronously at GameController:185, which resolves the conflict, runs the aftermath
     *       phase, and clears the active conflict all before processAction returns. Test: after
     *       initiating a conflict through the controller, the active conflict is null and the
     *       aftermath phase ran within the same action.
     *
     * Divergence reported (not fixed — game-logic out of scope):
     *   - Victory check timing: rulebook III Draw Round Step 5 vs engine mid-action-phase check.
     *     Already recorded in DECISIONS B5-0359 (line 1416) and B5-0409 finding A (line 2385).
     *   - Synchronous conflict resolution: rulebook III has a separate Resolution Round; engine
     *     resolvesConflicts synchronously at initiation. Already recorded in DECISIONS B5-0359
