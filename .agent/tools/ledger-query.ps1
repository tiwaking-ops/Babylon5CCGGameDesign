.SYNOPSIS
  Read-only ledger census + claim-liveness query tool (B5-0609).
.DESCRIPTION
  Prints one line per row of .agent/TASK_LEDGER.md matching an optional status
  filter (default OPEN) as: ID | status | pipeCount | doubleLead | claimOwner |
  claimAgeMin | hbAgeMin | reportAgeMin | verdict [reason] | defectReport

  Hard rules (B5-0609 spec):
    * Parses ONLY structured row-start fields (^|B5-xxxx|status|). Task IDs that
      appear inside narrative cells (e.g. heartbeat last_completed prose) are
      never treated as rows or claims.
    * The agent_id -> heartbeat filename join normalises punctuation on BOTH
      sides (colons, U+2028/U+2029, spaces, dashes, underscores stripped) so
      "solar-pro4:free" matches the heartbeat file "solar-pro4<U+2028>free.json".
    * THREE-SIGNAL LIVENESS (B5-0659, human-approved 2026-09-27), implementing the
      rule already binding in .agent/HEARTBEATS/README.md section "Liveness: three
      signals, never one":
        live(T) <=> newest of ( claim started_utc, or claim file mtime when
                             unparseable
                           , owner heartbeat file mtime
                           , report file mtime ) is within the TTL
      Verdicts: LIVE = at least one signal found and within TTL; STALE = at least
      one found and none within TTL; UNKNOWN = a required signal absent or
      unparseable. A reaper may remove a claim only when NO signal is fresh.
      The owner heartbeat is REQUIRED, so its absence is UNKNOWN with a reason and
      is never read as freshness. The report signal is CONTRIBUTING-ONLY: a report
      is written at close-out, so its ordinary absence before then must not
      manufacture an UNKNOWN on every in-flight task, and a report that does exist
      legitimately refreshes the task. An UNCLAIMED row is neither LIVE nor STALE
      and carries no signal at all.
    * CLAIMS-FIRST (B5-0657, human-approved 2026-09-27): reads .agent/CLAIMS/
      before reporting and marks any row whose claim is not provably stale as
      `suppressed-live-claim` in the defectReport column, with a footer naming
      the suppressed rows. A row under repair reads as a transient state that
      belongs to a DIFFERENT defect class than its committed form, so reporting
      it manufactures false defects. The suppressed rows must be re-censused
      after the claim releases.
    * Strictly read-only: no ledger, claim, heartbeat, report or pattern writes.
.NOTES
  Manual fallback one-liner (capture-only rg, tolerates leading double pipe):
    rg -o --no-filename '^\|+\s*B5-[0-9]{4}[a-z]?\s*\|' .agent/TASK_LEDGER.md
.PARAMETER Status
  Filter on the status cell (default "OPEN"). Use "*", "" or "ALL" for all rows.
  (B5-1010: ALL is a wildcard alias, not a literal status. Before this fix, ALL
  fell through to a literal cell match, matched nothing, and exited 0 — an empty
  result indistinguishable from a clean ledger, the worst failure mode for a
  census instrument. An unrecognised value now fails loudly with exit 3 instead
  of printing an empty table, keeping the B5-0777 principle: a census that could
  not do its job must never report as a clean one. Exit 3 is deliberately
  distinct from 0/1/2: 3 = could-not-interpret, never matched-nothing.)

  B5-1017: the verdict cell is now LABELLED so no consumer can mistake a
  reported age for an adjudicated one. The two liveness tools hold different,
  each-defensible designs — this query REPORTS what the files say (a
  forged-future started_utc prints its age, negative), while run-queue APPLIES
  policy (refuses to offer on it). A claim more than 60 minutes ahead of the
  sampled UTC clock is now UNKNOWN rather than LIVE; smaller skew remains
  tolerated. What made that difference a defect was that
  nothing on the page said so: a plain "LIVE" could mean "adjudicated live" or
  "the arithmetic of an unverified timestamp". LIVE/STALE verdicts now carry a
  [reported-age] label exactly when the claim's started_utc was accepted
  unverified; UNSTEALABLE-policy verdicts (absent heartbeat, future-dated) are
  printed with their policy reason as before. The crosscheck's Get-Word still
  reads the leading token, so its comparisons are unchanged..PARAMETER TtlMinutes
    Liveness window (default 30, per 00_BOOT step 2).

B5-1020 (2026-09-30): content-exempt pipe classification. A non-7-pipe row whose
excess pipes fall strictly inside a double-quoted span, a backtick span, or a row
carrying an explicit in-row prior adjudication marker (the literal phrase
"left intact", the convention the adjudicated rows themselves use) is reported as
`exempt (<classes>)` in the defectReport column instead of `reportable`.

  * The exempt class exists ONLY for pipes inside quoted or adjudicated spans.
    A new free pipe in plain unquoted prose is STILL A DEFECT — there is no
    operator, parenthetical, or bare-pipe exemption, because a detector that
    exempts by row instead of by position would pass every other test.
  * Span classes apply only when the span delimiters are PAIRED (even count on
    the line); single-quote spans are deliberately NOT a class (apostrophes in
    prose make them unsafe), and the classifier requires
    pipeCount - exemptPipes == 7 EXACTLY — any leftover or over-strip stays
    `reportable`. DoubleLead rows are never exempt: the lead-pipe repair duty is
    independent of the count.
  * Conservative toward reporting MORE: every ambiguity lands on `reportable`,
    never on `exempt`. No exit code, threshold, TTL, verdict, or the 7-pipe
    contract is changed by this classification.

    # never reports a row that another agent is mid-repair on as a defect.
    #
    # Grounding: a census taken while a live claim covers the row reads a
    # TRANSIENT state, and the transient state belongs to a different defect
    # class than the committed form. B5-0564/B5-0565 both read 6 pipes mid-repair
    # under claim B5-0592, which looks like a missing-trailing-delimiter defect;
    # git show d8216afa confirms the committed form was 8 pipes with a leading
    # double pipe. A naive pipe census reports two false defects.
    #
    # Keyed off the FILENAME, before JSON parsing, so a claim file this tool cannot
    # read is ALSO suppressed. An unreadable file is not evidence of a defect, and
    # the fail-safe direction here is toward silence: the protocol's own remedy for
    # a suppressed row is re-census after release, not a report.
    #
    # "Provably stale" means every DETERMINABLE signal is older than the TTL. An
    # absent owner heartbeat is absent information and is never read as staleness,
    # which is the B5-0609 defect class (a lookup matching nothing returned -1, and
    # -1 compares as younger than any TTL, manufacturing LIVE from an absent signal).
    #
    # B5-0659: the three-signal rule from .agent/HEARTBEATS/README.md, so the report
    # mtime participates too. The comment above already promised that an absent
    # heartbeat is not staleness, but the code did the opposite -- the heartbeat was
    # folded in only `if ($heartbeats.ContainsKey($k))`, so a claim whose owner has
    # no heartbeat file fell through to claim age alone and could be reported
    # reportable on the strength of the one signal that was never in dispute. Now a
    # claim with no matching heartbeat is NOT provably stale and is suppressed, which
    # is the fail-safe direction the protocol already states: an unreadable signal is
    # not evidence of a defect, and the remedy for a suppressed row is re-census
    # after release, not a report.
    #
    # The verdict predicate is deliberately IDENTICAL to Test-LiveClaim in
    # .agent/run-queue.ps1. Two tools disagreeing about which rows are reportable
    # would recreate exactly the defect class this protocol exists to stop, and
    # .agent/tools/census-crosscheck.ps1 is the shipped instrument for proving they
    # agree. B5-0953: run-queue.ps1 now answers UNKNOWN and suppresses on a
    # missing or unjoinable owner heartbeat exactly as this copy always has,
